computer architecture book notes

An
operating system interfaces between a user’s program and the hardware and provides a variety of services and supervisory functions. Among the most important
functions are
■ handling basic input and output operations
■ allocating storage and memory
■ providing for sharing the computer among multiple applications using it
simultaneously

-----------------------------------------

Examples of operating systems in use today are Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
Compilers perform another vital function: the translation of a program written in a high-level language, such as C or Java, into instructions that the hardwarecan execute. Given the sophistication of modern programming languages and the
simple instructions executed by the hardware, the translation from a high-level
language program to hardware instructions is complex. We will give a brief overview of the process and return to the subject in Chapter 2. 

------------------------------------------

Assembly language requires the programmer to
write one line for every instruction that the machine will follow, forcing the programmer to think like the machine. 

------------------------------------------


compiler turn high-level programming language code into assembly code. then assembly turns it into binary.


-------------------------------------------

The
underlying hardware in any computer performs the same basic functions: inputting data, outputting data, processing data, and storing data.
